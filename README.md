## What is ocdev?
OpenShift Command line for Developers

## Pre-requisites
- OpenShift version 3.7.0 and up

To use ocdev you need access to an OpenShift instance and have OpenShift CLI installed on your local machine (`oc` should be in your $PATH).

### OpenShift instance
You can use [Minishift](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/index.html) to get a local instance of OpenShift. However ocdev can be used with any instance of OpenShift.

### OpenShift CLI
There are different ways to install OpenShift CLI. 
Please follow [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli).

## Installation
To install `ocdev` on your system, you cat use the fully automated [install.sh](./scripts/install.sh) script.
This script will enable ocdev repository on your system and install ocdev using package manager depending on your system.
Supported systems are Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS and macOS. You can find more information about package repositories in 
[Advanced installation guide](./docs/advanced-installation-guide.md)

```
curl -L https://github.com/redhat-developer/ocdev/raw/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```


If you don't want to add extra package repositories to your system you can just extract  `ocdev` binary from [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/redhat-developer/ocdev/releases) to one of the directories that are in your `$PATH`.

For macOS:

```
sudo curl -L  "https://github.com/redhat-developer/ocdev/releases/download/v0.0.3/ocdev-darwin-amd64.gz" | gzip -d > /usr/local/bin/ocdev; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ocdev
```

For Linux:
```
sudo curl -L  "https://github.com/redhat-developer/ocdev/releases/download/v0.0.3/ocdev-linux-amd64.gz" | gzip -d > /usr/local/bin/ocdev; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ocdev
```

You can also download latest master builds from [Bintray](https://dl.bintray.com/ocdev/ocdev/latest/). This is updated every time there is a change in master git branch.



## Concepts
- An **_application_** is, well, your application! It consists of multiple microservices or components, that work individually to build the entire application.
- A **_component_** can be thought of as a microservice. Multiple components will make up an application. A component will have different attributes like storage, etc.
Multiple component types are currently supported, like nodejs, perl, php, python, ruby, etc.

## Getting Started
Developing applications using ocdev is as simple as -
- `ocdev application create <name>`
- `ocdev component create <name>`
- `ocdev component push`

Check out our [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide and get going!
